# HomeLab
This is where I’ll be documenting my HomeLab setup. Starting with two VMS Kali Linux as the attacker and Ubuntu as the defender. I will use these to simulate isolated virtual labs with internet access provided by NAT while internal communication between the VMS is handled on a Host-Only Network. A bridged connection wasn't possible due to my apartment's WI-FI configuration. I’ll include a visual map and update things as the lab grows.
